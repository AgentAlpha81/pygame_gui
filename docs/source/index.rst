Pygame GUI Documentation
===================================================

Pygame GUI is a module to help you make graphical user interfaces in for games written in pygame. The module is firmly
forward looking and is designed to work on Pygame 2 and Python 3. Some features may not work on earlier versions of
pygame and its doubtful whether any of it works under Python 2.

Features
--------

 - Theme-able UI elements/widgets - you can use JSON theme files to change the colours, fonts and other appearance
   related details of your UI without touching your code.

 - A subset of HTML is supported for drawing word-wrapped text. Have bolded words in the middle of a paragraph of text!
   Stick a link in there! Go absolutely hog wild, within the bounds of the defined subset of HTML the module supports.

 - Buttons, text entry, scroll bars and drop down menus all supported, with more on the way.

 - A window stack that will let you keep a bunch of moveable windows of 'stuff' around and correctly sorted.

 - As closely respecting of the pygame way of doing things as I could get away with.

Getting Started
