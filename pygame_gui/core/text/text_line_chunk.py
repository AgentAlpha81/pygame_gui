"""
A bit of renderable text that fits on a single line and all in the same style.

Blocks of text are made up of many text chunks. At the simplest level there would be one per line.

On creation a text chunk calculates how much space it will take up when rendered to a surface and
stores this size information in a rectangle. These rectangles can then be used in layout
calculations.

Once a layout for the text chunk is finalised the chunk's render function can be called to add the
chunk onto it's final destination.

TODO:
  - Experiment with being font type agnostic as much as possible. I have a suspicion that freetype
    font might be more useful here because of render_to() and maybe the background colour default
    but it's worth testing all these assumptions and the speed of both.
  - Do we need an intermediate type that links together - chunks, the html parser and the layout
    managers? Mainly thinking about new lines like <br> and /n. Seems unlikely so far?
  - Performance comparison tests & functionality comparison tests between current system and new.
    Need to set these up early.
