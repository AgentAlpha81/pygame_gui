# Pygame GUI
A GUI system for pygame 2 (it may also work OK on earlier versions of pygame).

## How to install

1. Run this command in a command prompt:
```
pip install pygame_gui
```
2. If all goes well you should see a message about game_gui being installed successfully and will be able to find pygame_gui in the list of installed packages for your python interpreter (PyCharm displays these as a nice list under File->Settings->Project:project_name->Project Interpreter). 
3. Should you need to delete pygame_gui for any reason then PyCharm will also let you do that from the same Project Interpreter settings window using the red minus symbol button.

## Making use of the library

There is documentation available [here](https://pygame-gui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), you can also try out the examples at the [pygame_gui_examples repository](https://github.com/MyreMylar/pygame_gui_examples).
